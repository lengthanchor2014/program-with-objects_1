              Object Oriented Programming  allows data and set of instructions to be packaged together by creating objects (aka Classes) so that it can be used for repetitive tasks. For example Classes allow coders to create functions and define variable then store them inside a class so that coder can later call an instance into another program and access all at the functions and variable stored in a class. OOP is valuable tool in large programming projects since we can designing patterns, manipulate code, keep code organized, and add protective layers to a program since everything stored in a class. If the coder does decides to manipulate class variables or functions all they have to do implement Inheritance from a previous class and perform Method Override  to  overwrite the properties from the initial class making OOP a very useful tool since it can help others coders to work and improve on your code.

                Steps To Using Object Oriented Programming
        </div>

        <div class="concept-description">

      <p>
      
              Identify all the objects the programmer wants to manipulate, find how they relate to each other which is usually done in Pseudo coding layout. Once an object has been identified,  it is generalized as a class of objects which defines the kind of data it contains and logic sequences or method can manipulate it.

        </div>

        <div class="concept-description">

      <p>
      
              Class is a blueprint were you can package variables and functions together. A good example is “Class MOVIE ():” we can use data type (def __init__) or method type (def show_trailer) to perform certain tasks in other programs.

                CONSTRUCTOR
        </div>

        <div class="concept-description">

      <p>
      
              Constructor initialize all of the data associated with instance using (def __init__), first argument(self), and with the rest of the arguments up to the programmer. Example is def __init__ (self, movie_title):

        <div class="concept-description">

      <p>
      
              Instance variables unique to an object and can be accessed using self inside class and instance name outside the class. Example would be def __init__ (self, movie_title) then the instance variable would be self.title = movie_title where the Instance variable movie_title can be used through out your program.

        <div class="concept-description">

      <p>
      
              All of the functions outside the class that are associated to instance and have 1 argument self are instance method. Example would be “def show trailer(self)” where the Instance method “show trailer” can called in another program and use it’s function.

      <p>
      
              Instance or object can be thought of as the word “represent” since When you represent a class. Example would be AMY = Class Shows ():, so AMY would be considered the object or instance of the CLASS Shows.

      <p>
      
              A module is a file with pre-written python code (for example we created function code and saved the file as fun.py) we can then import the file into another python code using “import fun” that can open, run the code, and use it’s function in another program.

      <p>
      
              A library is a collection of programs that can perform certain tasks. So in python we call for the Python’s Standard library to select tools to use in our code to manipulate data to get solutions otherwise would be complicated.

      <p>
      
              Inheritance allows one class to use another classes properties (data or functions). Ex - Let’s say Class A (): has a method amy = class Name(Age). Well Class B: () can inherit the class properties from class A.

              Class variables can be referenced directly from the class, and this can be used as one way to make an constant, or they can be referenced from any instance in the class.

                ABSTRACT THINKING
        </div>

        <div class="concept-description">

      <p>
      
              In abstract thinking you’re basically grabbing the essential characteristic and managing complicated program by cutting it down into smaller chunks. My HTML generator program does a really good job of connecting OOP with HTML and CSS together to generate web design. I first organized my code using OOP to define a class called Concept that created objects that represented the following information. Constructor (def __init__ ) to generate variables title, description, and paragraphs that could be used used by CSS to change the look and formatting of the HTML document. Method type (def generate_html) to generate HTML string since the HTML was repetitive code that used TITLE and DESCRIPTION to populate the HTML code. Once the code was complete we had an output of HTML code. With this HTML CODE and CSS CODE we could generate web design. Using OOP was able to shorten amount of code  to produce a HTML code and have variables available to implement CSS code to them. With this cohesiveness between OOP, HTML, and CSS we can keep the code simplified, better organized, and use only the important data.
